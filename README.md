Arduino project demonstrating the functionality of the Ultrasonic Sensor Module. 

- Functionality: Device continually reads distance from module to closest object directly in front and displays value to the screen in the format "Distance: __ cm," flashes warning lights if object is moving closer to the module, and ultimately sounds an alarm when the distance reaches <10cm.

- Device was intended to act as a "Backup Camera" of sorts for my car which has no type of assistive feature, allowing myself to park in tight spaces with a little more confidence.
